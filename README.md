# ApolloAPI

ApolloAPI allows you to set a custom Reddit and Imgur API for Apollo. With it installed, go to Settings -> General inside of Apollo and select "Custom API" in the right corner of the navigation bar. From there, you can enter your own API keys along with directions on how to get your own keys.

A custom user agent can also be set by going to the user profile tab and clicking User Agent on the top right.

## Installation
